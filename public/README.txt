Copy the `images/` folder from your existing project into this folder so the app can reference /images/*.

From your current workspace:
- Copy c:\Users\Pericles\code\siteGlenda\images to c:\Users\Pericles\code\siteGlenda-react\public\images

Then run:
  npm install
  npm run dev

If you need me to copy images for you, grant permission and I'll attempt to create the files here (binary images are not available to generate).
